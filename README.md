### Origin story

> Plugin was originally developed by @Florke64 for a _public skyblock server project_,
> that was active at the time and with a group of friends met online. As I left the project, plugin was abandoned.
> At the moment, nobody of us is using it anymore; As a code owner, I decided to update licensing to GPLv3, then publish the code.
> Legacy versions used directly on Go2Play.pl server are available in `g2p-legacy` and `g2p-legacy-prerelease` branches.
> You can study code, however I don't give permission to use old legacy versions of this plugin as it was exclusive for Go2Play at the time.
> Please remember to read the license.
